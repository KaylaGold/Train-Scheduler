Check it out! https://kaylagold.github.io/Train-Scheduler/

This train-scheduler app incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The app retrieves
and manipulates the information with Moment.js. The site will provide up-to-date information about various trains,
their arrival times, and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.
